||  TO DO:  ||

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MAIN PRIORITY 
    - Refactoring the entire game, converting it from table-based into a canvas based game utilizing the Fabric.js framework
    - We still need to:
        + Finish up vehicle animations (dynamic durations and having the spawns and despawns be dynamic)
        + Reimplement grid-style tower placement and reimplement the shop menu for tower purchases and main menu for level selection
        + Reimplement tower ranges and work on tower vehicle-tracking and projectiles
        + Reimplement the HUD and buttons to pause and quit the game
    - After the game reaches the same state of functionality as the old version we need to:
        + Reskin the game to match our new prompt
        + Apply all of the fixes and other tasks in the next TO-DO's
    - If (and only if) we have time after we complete everything else:
        + Implement a random map generation algorithm as a fifth map option for the user
        + Implement a save mechanic where the level number, player money, tower placements, upgrades, etc are all saved to their account
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
2. Hover context menus for each tower in the shop -- displaying cost, sell price, and other stats
    - This would apply when you hover over any option in the shop and should appear next to the given option
    - Also when you hover over a cell with a tower on it, it should display a small menu near it with some info about its stats and upgrades
    - SUGGESTION: Try out Bootstrap.css to make this easier

3. REBALANCING THE GAME 
    - Vehicles should take away more cleanliness
    - Garbage trucks are good but we should include more variety in the early-game
    - The only real "difficult" vehicle is the garbage truck
    - HUGE difficulty gap between levels 24 and 25, make the ones leading up to 25 more difficult as well
    - Make upgrades more enticing -- there's no real motivation to pick them over buying a next-level tower yet
    - Add tower degredation!!!!

4. Re-skinning the game to comply with new prompt (the wifi thing -- we gotta collectively brainstorm about that)

5. Add various new features (brainstorm -- we have time now, but don't procrastinate)

6. Maybe create algorithm for random map generation (in addition to the 4 premade maps of course)
  
||  LIST O' BUGS: ||

1. Upgrades for towers aren't working
    - I can only confirm this for defensive towers as upgrading their damage yielded no damage increases
    
2. For some reason the identifier in the shop doesn't work correctly for the oil production tower
    - It displays as [Object Object]
